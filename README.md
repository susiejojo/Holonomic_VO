# Holonomic_VO

### Constraints used: 

- obst_rad = 0.2;
- agent_rad = 0.1;
- sensor_range = 3;
- time_sample = 0.1;
- vmax = 0.4;
- 4 obstacles

### Tests performed:

- Two types of distance functions used - desired velocity, minimising norm of distance.
- Different no of obstacles, different radii of obstacles and agent
- Obstacles and agent velocity in direction of desired velocity.
- Obstacles and agent on a direct collision path.
